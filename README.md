# PyChemistry-program
A program in python to solve general chemistry problems.
My current objective is to have an acceptable GUI with comboboxes and text entry boxes 
placed so the user can input all the information needed to solve problems in general chemistry.
My next objective is to create a database -- probably with SQLite -- with tables for elements, compounds and ions
and queries to select a record and update program variables. The selected items from the comboboxes and entry textboxes 
will fill the record fields. 
I can currently use the variables to work on program logic, but I am open to a better way to organize the data. 
Objects would be an easy way to organize and I am not concerned with memory usage or processing speed.
During a program session, when I am solving many different problems, the variables will change many times. 
After I get everything working, I am willing to rewrite whatever much of the program to make it work better.
